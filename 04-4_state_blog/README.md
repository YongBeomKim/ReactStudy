## Introduction

Today I'll be sharing the first part to a video series where I will be developing a full stack web application using React and Django with the Django Rest Framework. 

This is going to be a blog application with a couple of interesting features. I will also be using Bootstrap 4 for the styling in the application.

implemented:

1. You will see how to implement a widget to create the blog post content which will be done using Django Summernote.
2. The blog posts will have a category, and in the application you will be able to filter the blog posts by category.
3. You will see how to have a slug automatically generated for you based on the title you provided.
4. You will see how to avoid having duplicate slugs so that you can even have posts in your application with the same title.
5. You will see how to have a featured blog that will be displayed at the top of the blog page.
6. You will see how to have it so that when you set another blog post to be featured, the previously featured blog post will be automatically removed from being featured.
