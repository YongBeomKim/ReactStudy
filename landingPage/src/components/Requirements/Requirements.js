            Users want to find answers to their questions quickly and data shows
            that people really care about how quickly their pages load. The
            Search team announced speed would be a ranking signal for desktop
            searches in 2010 and as of this month (July 2018), page speed will
            be a ranking factor for mobile searches too.

            Are you shipping too much JavaScript? Too many images? Images and
            JavaScript are the most significant contributors to the page weight
            that affect page load time based on data from HTTP Archive and the
            Chrome User Experience Report - our public dataset for key UX
            metrics as experienced by Chrome users under real-world conditions.
